                    Korean food is one of the most popular cuisines worldwide. It ranked 4th in a study about the most popular international cuisines on Instagram.
                    Korean offer something that foodies have begun craving for: an experience.
                    It’s not only about the food you’re fed: the experience itself is just as important.
                    And perhaps the huge success of the film Parasite helped turned the world’s attention to South Korea and everything it has to offer.

                                    When it's done right, the chewy, tender octopus swims in a thick, dark red, caramelized sauce, so good that you can ignore the fact that it sets your mouth aflame to keep eating.</p>

                                But key to this dish is that the steamed pork is sliced into squares slightly larger than a bite, lovingly wrapped in a leaf of lettuce, perilla, or kimchi, and daubed with a dipping sauce. There are two traditional options: ssamjang, made of chili paste and soybean paste (doenjang), or saeujeot, a painfully salty pink sauce made of tiny pickled shrimp.
                                Wrapping and dipping are essential.</p>

                                The dish is also a fusion favorite: bulgogi-flavored burgers are part of the menu at fast food franchise Lotteria, and there have also been sightings of other adaptations like the bulgogi panini.</p>

                                Bibim naengmyeon, or "mix" naengmyeon, generally contains the same ingredients, but minus the broth.</p>

                            Feeling adventurous? Exchange your regular red cabbage kimchi for ggakdugi (chopped radish kimchi), a popular side at gimbap restaurants. Yeolmumul kimchi is a less spicy kimchi made with young radish stalks floating in a tangy soup.

                            The soft tofu -- which breaks into fluffy chunks in the stew -- holds the flavor of the clam and serves as a relief from the overall spiciness.
                            Proper sundubu-jjigae comes in a traditional earthenware pot designed to retain heat. The egg is cracked into the stew after serving, and cooks inside the bowl.</p>
